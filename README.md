  Modular, pluggable admin for Medusa
</p>


## Getting Started

Visit the [Nocto](https://noctojs.com) to set up a Nocto application.

## What is Nocto

Nocto is a modular, pluggable admin panel built on top of Medusa. It’s designed for developers and teams who want full control over their commerce admin tool — from UI customization to new feature integration.

With Nocto, you can easily replace, extend, and compose your admin experience using a modern and maintainable plugin-based architecture.

## Why Nocto?

The default Medusa Admin has its limitations (non-configurable sidebar, predefined injection zones etc.) - but **Nocto** is for those who want more. It gives you the power to mold the interface to your vision.

Built with modern web tech, it prioritizes flexibility, clarity, and modularity.

Use Nocto for:

 - Custom Sidebar – Replace, add or remove items on the sidebar
 - Pluggable UI elements – Create your own UI plugin and install it on top of Nocto. Replace existing pages or add completely new ones wherever you want.
 - Dynamic slots – Tailor the UI by injecting your components into existing modules which are exposing the slots
 - RBAC - render different UI for different users. Fully backend-agnostic.
